	{ day: 16, prompt: "Color gradients gone wrong", title: "", info: "<p>Just a happy accident.</p><p>It happens while I was making the artwork of day one. I tried to multiply the <code>i</code> times the <code>j</code> in a pixel grid, and the resultant hue color was this strange pattern.</p><p>I don't understand it, but I love it.</p>" },
