## La iniciativa

> ### Genuary?
> 
> GENUARY is back! GENUARY is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful things.
> 
> It's happening during the month of January 2022, and everybody is invited!
> 
> Over the 744 hours of January, every 24 hours there is a new prompt for your code art.
> 
> You don't have to follow the prompt exactly. Or even at all. But, y'know, we put effort into this.
> 
> You can use any language, framework or medium, on any planet.
> 
> Share your work and tag it with #genuary and #genuary2022.
> 
> ### Prompts
> 
> Click for the [prompts](https://genuary.art/prompts#jan4) for each day. These are the actual prompts, but you're only supposed to do them on that particular day.
> 
> ### Tips & Tricks
> 
> * Prepare a nice framework for yourself before January to quickly be able to start trying out ideas.
> * Don't get burned out doing dailies. This is supposed to be fun and creative. If you start to resent dailies, or you find that it's stunting you creatively, then ramp down your goals (and time spent) to just what you want to get out of this. Fun? Practicing skills? Learning? Breaking boredom? Getting ideas? It's fine to skip days. If you've been on a streak and only have a few days left, you've got this.
> * There's a prompt for each day, but you can do them in advance (or later!) if it's convenient. No one is here to throw off your schedule.
> 
> There's also a [FAQ](https://genuary.art/faq) with frequently asked questions!
> 
> ### 31 DAYS, 31 PROGRAMS / ALGORITHMS / MACHINES / AUTOMATONS
