# Genuary21

El subreddit [r/generative](https://www.reddit.com/r/generative), ha creat un seguit de prompts per a cada dia de gener per crear art generatiu:

## La iniciativa

>### Genuary?
>GENUARY is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful things.
>
>It happens during the month of January 2021.
>
>For every 24 hour day within this 744 hour timespan, we have prepared a prompt with instructions for you to execute.
>
>You don't have to follow the prompt exactly. Or even at all. But, y'know, we put effort into this.
>
>You can use any language, framework or medium. Please respect the Geneva Conventions.
>
>Share your work and tag it with #genuary and #genuary2021. If you're going to misspell it as #genaury, please go all in and include all permutations.
>
>### Prompts
>
>Click for the [prompts](https://genuary2021.github.io/prompts) for each day. These are the actual prompts, but you're only supposed to do them on that particular day. Though if you decided to cheat and implement all these prompts before the start of January 2021, that would actually be pretty impressive. Share them too!
>
>### Tips & Tricks
>
>* Short on time? Need to skip a day? Try and work two prompts (or three, or four) into a single program. How's this for efficiency?
>* Don't get burned out doing dailies. This is supposed to be fun and creative. If you start to resent dailies, or you find that it's stunting you creatively, then ramp down your goals (and time spent) to just what you want to get out of this. Fun? Practicing skills? Learning? Breaking boredom? Getting ideas? It's fine to skip days. If you've been on a streak and only have a few days left, you've got this.
>* There's a prompt for each day, but you can do them in advance (or later!) if it's convenient. No one is here to throw off your schedule.
